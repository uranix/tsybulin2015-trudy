\arthead{Tsybulin I.\,V., Skalko Y.\,I., Pavlova E.\,S.}{A distributed version of the long characteristics method for the equation of radiative transfer}

\begin{abstract}
A modified version of long characteristics method used for the radiative transfer problem is proposed. The method is suitable for solving the equation on a decomposed unstructured tetrahedral grid. Interprocess communication is required only for solving an auxilary problem on the domain interfaces. Utilization of the long characteristsics admits a simple representation of the auxilary problem which reduces to solving a small sized sparse linear system of equations.
